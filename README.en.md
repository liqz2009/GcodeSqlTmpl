# GcodeSql
  
GcodeSql is a free MySql database management software developed for programmers, providing a database-based code generation tool that can significantly improve developers' productivity  and make the code more standardized.
  
Currently, it supports Java and c# languages on the backend, with plans to introduce PHP and Go templates to quickly complete single table operations such as addition, deletion, modification, and querying. The multi-table join function is currently being developed and  will be available in future versions Unlike other generation tools, it is a project-level code generation based on frameworks and provides a complete set of specification files. The  template file uses the standard [ejs](https://ejs.bootcss.com/) language (please refer to the official website for ejs  specifications), and you can write your own templates according to your project needs.  
  
Currently, this management tool only supports MySql-compliant databases, with plans to release   versions for SQL Server and other databases in the future.
  
The front-end JS framework code generation is still in the development stage, with some bugs that need to be fixed and functionality that needs to be improved.
